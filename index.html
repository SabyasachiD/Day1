    git config
A convenient way to set configuration options for your Git installation. You’ll typically only need to use this immediately after installing Git on a new development machine.
    Git add
Moves changes from the working directory to the staging area. This gives you the opportunity to prepare a snapshot before committing it to the official history.

Git clone
Creates a copy of an existing Git repository. Cloning is the most common way for developers to obtain a working copy of a central repository.

git status
Displays the state of the working directory and the staged snapshot. You’ll want to run this in conjunction with git add and git commit to see exactly what’s being included in the next snapshot.
